        <h2>The Art of Hip Hop Lyricism</h2>
    	<p>Hip Hop is not a style of music; it is a <em>culture</em> from which a musical identity has evolved. Hip Hop artists express themselves with dance, paint, turntables, instruments, and the written word. It is my humble opinion that Hip Hop lyricism is the most complex and dexterous form of writing in practice.</p>
        <p>Science, Substance, and Style: The Art of Hip Hop Lyricism is a guide to the intricate inner workings of well-written Hip Hop lyrics. From cadence, to wordplay, to multisyllabic rhymes and more, each aspect of what makes a rap verse a work of art will be explored.</p>
